									Looking back in history have you ever wondered what mysteries and hidden treasures were forgotten and lost to the world. You now find yourself in a position to find a long lost treasure, that was hidden by the earliest founders of our nation. It has remained hidden to this day, but there are clues that would lead us to believe it can be found. This treasure horde has a document that was signed on November 11, 1620. I cannot recall what that document is but with your bright young minds I am sure you can.

								<p>What is that Document?</p>
