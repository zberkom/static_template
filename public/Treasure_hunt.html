					<p>	Now that you have proven yourself to be worthy of continuing the quest I will have to set out some rules for you. </p>
  					<li>You are not allowed to inspect the code in order to look for answers to questions asked you. </li>
  					<li>Do not ask other people to help you answer the various questions that are asked you during the hunt. </li>
					<p>You are a young and aspiring knight and are about to set out upon the noble quest of regaining a lost gem that is now deep in a maze of mountains called the Devilâ€™s Cleft. To accomplish the task you will need a sharp mind in order to easily pick out the paths you should take. You are now in the armory shop and are considering buying an axe, sword, or spear. Oh and I forgot to mention that a foul worm guards the mysterious pathway. Beware and be on your guard. Every decision you make will impact whether you will succeed in your quest.
